Homework 5 
1. What is the DOM? What is meant by the DOM tree? 
The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents, The DOM tre allows programs to interact with and modify the contents, structure, and style of a webpage, the DOM tree consists of 4 types of nodes: Document node (the page), element node (individual elements), attribute nodes (attributes), text nodes (text) 


2. What is an XSS attack? How do they work? How can you guard against them? 
XSS attack is a cross-site scripting attack where malicious scripts are injected into web pages viewed by users. To guard against avoiding putting untrusted user input into HTML, validate inputs if given the option to, strip it of malicious intent by removing tags, escaping characters, etc.


3. What is an event in JavaScript? What kind of events can you respond to with code? 
An event is an action or occurrence detected by JavaScript, such as user interactions and Events might be UI(Load, Unload, etc.), Keyboard(key down, Keyup, etc.), mouse(click, mouseover, etc.) focus, form(submit), mutation.


4. How does a DOM event listener work? What are the parameters it is expecting? 
DOM event listener
A DOM event listener is a method that listens for a specific event on an element and executes a function when the event occurs. The addEventListener method allows developers to attach event handlers to elements without overwriting existing ones. The three parameters it expects are the event type (e.g., "click", "keydown", "mouseover"), the callback function (the function that executes when the event fires), and an optional boolean for event capturing (true for capturing phase, false for bubbling phase).


5. What is jQuery? Why use it? How do we load jQuery onto a page? 


jQuery is a lightweight JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML document manipulation, event handling, and animations. jQuery allows developers to write less code while achieving the same results as native JavaScript. It is particularly useful for selecting elements, handling events, and making AJAX requests. jQuery is typically loaded onto a page using a CDN by including the script tag <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script> in the HTML file or by downloading and hosting the library locally.




6. What is AJAX? JSON? The HTTP method types and what they do?


AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique that allows web pages to send and receive data from a server asynchronously without reloading the entire page. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data format that is easy to read and write, commonly used for exchanging data between a browser and a server. The HTTP methods used in AJAX requests include GET (retrieves data from a server), POST (sends new data to a server), PUT (updates an entire resource), PATCH (partially updates a resource), and DELETE (removes a resource from a server).
7. Write some data in the JSON format. You can use this site https://jsonformatter.org/ to check if it’s in the correct format, making use of the “validate” button.




8. Create a webpage that contains an unordered list element which contains several list item elements. If a list item is clicked, change the color of it. Each list item should have a different color. 
       
9. Create a webpage that contains a button. Write jQuery code so that when the button is clicked an HTTP GET request is sent to a PHP backend. From the PHP backend(reference the php-project code found here: 
https://github.com/cisc3300/SP25-lecture-code/tree/main/2-20-lecture) return a json encoded associative array of data pertaining to your fake business. Make sure that it has at least a name and a price. Use the response returned on the frontend to create a div element for each piece of data, show the name and price of each item and give the elements some style. 
10. Create a webpage that contains a form element with some input elements. Write jQuery code so that when the form is submitted an HTTP POST request is sent to a PHP backend. From the PHP backend(reference the php-project code found here: 
https://github.com/cisc3300/SP25-lecture-code/tree/main/2-20-lecture) return an associative array with data for a success message that is JSON encoded. Use the response to create an HTML element that contains the message data, give it some proper styling.
